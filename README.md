# Print Farm Manager

A self-hosted web app for managing a multi-brand 3D printer farm. Replaces manual USB job distribution with centralized status monitoring and automated job dispatch — built to run 24/7 on a dedicated machine on your local network.

No cloud. No subscriptions. No vendor lock-in.

> **Security note:** This app has no built-in authentication. It is designed to run on a trusted local network only. Do not expose port 3000 (or 5173 in dev) to the internet — your printer API keys are served to any client that can reach the server. Run it behind your router's firewall or a local VPN.

---

## What It Does

- **Live fleet view** — see every printer's status, progress, and time remaining at a glance, auto-refreshing every 15 seconds
- **Automated job dispatch** — define projects and parts, upload G-code, and let the scheduler assign jobs to idle printers automatically
- **Operator confirmation flow** — every finished print requires a human sign-off before the next job dispatches, preventing runaway failures
- **Multi-brand support** — Prusa, Elegoo, Bambu, and Klipper printers in the same fleet, managed from one interface
- **CSV fleet import** — add 50 printers at once from a spreadsheet
- **TV dashboard mode** — a heads-up fleet summary designed for a monitor on the shop wall
- **Farm backup and restore** — export your entire farm config and job history as a single JSON file

## Quick Start (Development)

Requires **Node.js 22 LTS** — Node 24+ has known issues compiling the native SQLite dependency on Windows (see the [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md) for details).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joeltelling/print-farm-manager.git
cd print-farm-manager
npm install
cd client && npm install && cd ..
npm run build
npm run dev
```

- API server: `http://localhost:3000`
- Web UI (hot reload): `http://localhost:5173`

### Prefer Docker instead of a local Node.js install?

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joeltelling/print-farm-manager.git
cd print-farm-manager
docker compose up --build print-farm-manager-dev
```

- API server: `http://localhost:3000`
- Web UI (hot reload): `http://localhost:5173`

Run tests with `docker compose exec print-farm-manager-dev npm test`. See the `dev` service in `docker-compose.yml` for details.

## Installation (Production)

### Option A — Docker (recommended)

Requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (and Compose, bundled with Docker Desktop and modern Docker Engine installs).

#### Quickest start — pull the published image

No clone, no local build. A multi-arch image (`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`) is published automatically to GitHub Container Registry on every release — see [docs/docker-publish.md](docs/docker-publish.md). Save this as `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  print-farm-manager:
    image: ghcr.io/joeltelling/print-farm-manager:latest
    container_name: print-farm-manager
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - farm-data:/app/server/data
      - farm-gcode:/app/server/gcode

volumes:
  farm-data:
  farm-gcode:
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This same file works as a drop-in stack in Portainer (**Stacks → Add stack → Web editor**, paste it in, deploy) — no repo checkout needed there either.

Open `http://localhost:3000` in a browser, or replace `localhost` with the machine's LAN IP to access it from any device on the network.

**Updating** to the latest published image:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

**Useful commands:**

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `docker compose logs -f` | Follow server logs |
| `docker compose stop` | Stop the container (data is preserved) |
| `docker compose up -d` | Start it again |
| `docker compose down` | Stop and remove the container (volumes are preserved) |

Pin to a specific release instead of always tracking `latest` by using a version tag, e.g. `ghcr.io/joeltelling/print-farm-manager:1.2.0`. `edge` tracks the latest build of `main` between releases.

#### Building from source instead

If you're testing local changes rather than running a release, clone the repo and build with the `docker-compose.yml` at its root (uses `build:` instead of `image:`):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joeltelling/print-farm-manager.git
cd print-farm-manager
docker compose up -d --build
```

Updating this path pulls new source and rebuilds:

```bash
git pull
docker compose up -d --build
```

Without Compose, the equivalent `docker run` (published image) is:

```bash
docker run -d --name print-farm-manager --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v farm-data:/app/server/data \
  -v farm-gcode:/app/server/gcode \
  ghcr.io/joeltelling/print-farm-manager:latest
```

> Same security note as above applies inside Docker: only publish port 3000 to interfaces on your trusted LAN, not `0.0.0.0` on an internet-facing host.

### Option B — Bare metal (Node.js on the host)

For a full walkthrough covering prerequisites, network setup, auto-start with PM2, backup, updating, and troubleshooting on both Windows and macOS, see the **[Installation Guide](docs/installation.md)**.

The short version:

```bash
npm install
cd client && npm install && cd ..
npm run build
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in a browser, or replace `localhost` with the machine's LAN IP to access it from any device on the network.

## CSV Import Format

The fastest way to add a large fleet is via CSV import on the Settings page.

| Column | Required | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | Yes | `MK4S_01` |
| `ip` | Yes | `192.168.1.100` |
| `type` | Yes | `prusa` / `elegoo-centauri` / `elegoo-centauri2` / `bambu` / `klipper` / `octoprint` |
| `api_key` | Prusa and OctoPrint (API key), Bambu and Centauri Carbon 2 (LAN access code) | `aK3jR7xQ2pLm9vN` |
| `serial_number` | Bambu and Centauri Carbon 2 | `01S00C123456789` |
| `group` | No | `MK4S Farm` |
| `model` | No | `mk4s` |

If the `model` column is omitted, the model is inferred automatically from the printer name where possible; unrecognised models prompt for manual selection after import.
